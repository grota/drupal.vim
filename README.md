#Personal Drupal plugin for vim

This project is just a personal selection of the features found on this http://drupal.org/project/vimrc drupal project.

Currently it does nothing more than:

*  setting `ft=php` for drupal-specific files (i.e. `*.install,*.profile,*.theme,*.engine,*.test`).
*  setting `ft=drini` for `*.{info,make,build}` files.
*  providing a syntax file for the `drini` filetype (for color highlighting)
